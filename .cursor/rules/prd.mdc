# Journal Hero is an AI-driven Journaling app created to solve these pain points:

- Writers block. Having a prompt eliminates the "blank page" problem that stops many users from journaling. Instead of presenting an empty screen, the app uses AI to provide personalized, thought-provoking prompts based on the user's previous entries, goals, and mood.

- Provide mental clarity. The app's AI analyzes entries over time to identify recurring themes, emotional patterns, and behavioral triggers that the user might not see on their own.
  
- Build Your Daily Ritual. The biggest challenge in journaling is consistency. Journal Hero is designed to help users build and maintain a regular journaling habit with minimal effort. It uses intelligent, non-intrusive reminders that are optimized for the user's personal schedule. Gamification elements like daily streaks and achievements create a sense of accomplishment and positive reinforcement, turning journaling into a rewarding daily ritual rather than a chore.

- End-to-end privacy. Only you can read your diary entries. Your conversations are encrypted end-to-end, which means that they are always encrypted and only YOU have the master key to read them. Nobody else can read them even if there were a data leak from our servers.

# Application Screen Flow

## Onboarding screens

- Welcome! screen.
- Privacy Commitment screen.
- Setup Screen Step 1: Define Your Goals. What brings you to Journal Hero?
- Setup Screen Step 2: Choose your AI’s initial persona.

# Journal Entry Loop
- Diary Entry screen
    - Prompt at the top.
    - Text input field where the user writes their journal entry.
    - Two buttons: “Pull on a thread” or “Finish Entry”.
- After click on "Pull on a thread":
  - Show modal dialog with title: **"Which thought feels most important right now?"** Below this title, the AI generates 2-3 distinct prompts based on topics detected in the entry.
  - The user chooses one of the options and we go back to writing another diary entry, but this time with the newly selected prompt.

# "Finish Entry" & The Analysis Dialog
- Once the user taps "Finish Entry," the entry is saved, and the AI performs its analysis, presenting the results in a modal dialog. This is the "reward" for journaling.
- **Title:** An AI-generated summary title (e.g., "Reflections on a Difficult Conversation").
- **Synopsis**. It uses the user's chosen AI persona. It starts with something validating like, "It takes a lot of courage to reflect on this..." and connect the current entry to past themes or stated goals.
- **Insight:** A single, powerful sentence or two that presents the "blind spot" or a new perspective. Framed constructively, like: "It seems like feelings of 'imposter syndrome' often appear when you're about to take on a new challenge at work."
- **Quote:** A relevant quote that connects to the entry's theme.
- **Mood & Topics:** Automatically generated tags with associated emojis.
